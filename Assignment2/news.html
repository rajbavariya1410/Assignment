            Protest held near Pakistan High Commission in Delhi
            More than 500 people staged a protest near the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi against the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 people, mostly tourists, were killed.
            
            Holding placards and raising slogans against Pakistan, the protesters demanded decisive action against the neighbouring country, accusing it of supporting terror activities in India.
            
            The BJP, along with various social organisations like the Anti-Terror Action Forum, also participated in the protest.
            
            “Earlier, the government carried out a surgical strike. We demand similar action again to eradicate terrorism. This was a shameful attack on innocent tourists,” a member of the Anti-Terror Action Forum told PTI Videos.</article>

            <article>“Resign. The entire time is spent on forming and toppling Governments. The mind is busy for all 365 days of the year, plotting to eliminate political opponents. People’s safety is left to the Gods. Now even Lord Ram is fed up with these people. Resign. Do a favour towards the country,” Shiv Sena UBT MP Sanjay Raut posted on his social media account on X, along with a photograph of Amit Shah. The post went viral in a few minutes.

                Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra and the financial capital of the country, was put on alert. “All zones are on an alert. Patrolling has been intensified. Surprise checks are being conducted,” a senior official of the Mumbai Police told The Hindu.
                
                Maharashtra Government was in the process of collating the data about the visitors from the State who had gone to Pahalgam for tourism. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis identified the two deceased from Maharashtra as Dilip Disle and Atul Mone. He said that a couple of other tourists from the State were injured.

                <article>IPL Today Match, Points Table 2025, Orange Cap, Purple Cap, RCB vs RR Team Predicted Playing 11 Live Updates: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) will come into the IPL 2025 game against the Rajasthan Royals hoping to correct a very curious record that they have accrued this season: RCB are yet to win a game at home, while being undefeated on the road. As Virat Kohli pointed out in the previous game: “RCB have played some amazing cricket away from home.” Now, the question is, can they play that same brand of cricket at home?

                    Propelled by that away run of results, RCB find themselves fourth in the standings with 10 points from eight games while Rajasthan are stuck in 8th spot in IPL 2025, having garnered just four points from eight games.

                    The Rajasthan Royals will be without talismanic captain Sanju Samson, and will instead be led by Riyan Parag who was in charge at the start of the season. Rajasthan Royals come into the game on a four-match losing streak. More significantly, they have endured back-to-back heartbreaks in their previous two games after failing to score nine runs in the final over against Delhi Capitals (DC) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).</article>
