								CSS Box Model

Q1. Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border,
margin). How does each affect the size of an element?

=> 	Box Model:
		Every HTML element on a web page is like a box, and it has 4 parts:

	1. Content
		- This is where text or images appear.
		- It’s the main part of the box.

	2. Padding
		- Space inside the box, around the content.
		- Makes space between the content and the border.

	3. Border
		- A line around the padding and content.
		- You can change its color, size, and style.

	4. Margin
		- Space outside the box.
		- Creates distance between this box and other elements.

	How does it affect the size ?
		- Total size of an element = Content + Padding + Border + Margin
		- So, if you add padding, border, or margin, the element takes up more space on the page.

	Example: 
		width: 100px;
		padding: 10px;
		border: 5px;
		margin: 20px;

	 Total space used =
	100 (content) + 20 (padding) + 10 (border) + 40 (margin) = 170px wide.

Q2. : What is the difference between border-box and content-box box-sizing in CSS?
	Which is the default?

=> 	Box-Sizing 
	- It controls how the size of an element is calculated.
		1. Content-Box (Default).
			- width = only the content
			- Padding and border are added outside the width
			- So the element becomes bigger than what you set.

		2. Border-Box
			- width = content + padding + border
			- Everything fits inside the size you set
			-  So the element stays the size you set.

		-> content-box is the default in CSS.
