						Responsive Web Design with Media Queries			 

Q1.	What are media queries in CSS, and why are they important for responsive design?

=> Media queries are CSS rules that apply styles only when the screen size or device type matches certain conditions.

	- Why are they important?
		- They help make websites look good on all devices — phones, tablets, and computers — 		   by changing the layout and styles based on screen size.

	- Example:
		- @media (max-width: 600px) {
			  body {
				    background-color: lightblue;
				  }
			}
		- This changes the background to light blue only on small screens (600px wide or less).


Q2. Write a basic media query that adjusts the font size of a webpage for screens smaller than 600px

=>	 @media (max-width: 600px) {
  		body {
		    font-size: 14px;
		  }
	}
