	-Flexbox (Flexible Box) is a layout system in CSS that helps you arrange items in a row or 	column, and control spacing, alignment, and size easily — even when the screen size changes.
	
		- Flex Container
			The main box (parent) that holds the items. You set it like this: display: flex;
		-Flex Items
			The boxes inside the container (children). These are arranged by Flexbox.

		- Easy to align items left, right, center, top, or bottom.
