						Typography and Web Fonts

Q1. Explain the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts. Why might you use a web-safe font over a custom font?

=> 	Web-Safe Fonts
		- These are common fonts already installed on most devices.
		- Example: Arial, Times New Roman, Verdana
		- They load fast and work on almost all browsers.
	
	
	Custom Web Fonts
		- These are downloaded from the web, like Google Fonts.
		- Example: Roboto, Lobster, Open Sans
		- They look unique, but may load slower.

	Why use Web-Safe Fonts?
		- They are fast, reliable, and don’t depend on internet speed.
		- Good for performance and simple websites.


Q2. : What is the font-family property in CSS? How do you apply a custom Google Font to a webpage?

=> Font-Family in CSS
	- The font-family property sets the style of text on a webpage.
	- You can list one or more fonts.
	- Example:
		- body {
			 font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
		}

	- How to use a custom Google Font?
		- Go to fonts.google.com
		- Choose a font (e.g., Roboto)
		- Copy the link they give you
		- <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
		- Paste it in your HTML <head>
		- Use it in your CSS:
		- body {
			  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
		}
